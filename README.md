# GlusterFS

GlusterFS is a file system that is designed to provide network storage that can be made redundant, 
fault-tolerant and scalable. It’s particularly well suited to applications that require high-performance 
access to large files. With GlusterFS, you can have enterprise- or scientific-research-grade storage up 
and running in minutes, but it wouldn’t be our first choice for the type of simple file sharing that 
Samba or NFS are usually used for.
